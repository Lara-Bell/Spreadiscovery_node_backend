Don't Be A Jerk
Don't reproduce our data without permission. This is a free service. If you would like the service to do something it doesn't already, just email us and we can talk.

Cookies
We drop a few cookies to remember things like navigation/filtration options, etc. That's it.

Remarketing
We don't do it. By using this site you are not getting burned with mktg pixels or any such thing — apart from what Google already knows about you, which is a lot.

If You Give Us Your Email:
We will email you spread alerts. Be careful with your settings as you may get a lot. We recommend that you set your thresholds a bit higher/lower than you might think, as the crypto markets are quite noisy. We also might let you know about exciting things or partnerships we're up to in the future. Right now we're not doing anything exciting except sending simple spread alerts.
